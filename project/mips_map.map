WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net uart_shim/uart/ts is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,635 out of  15,822   10%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       596 out of  31,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        5,060
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         3,558 out of   5,060   70%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             105 out of 126,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
